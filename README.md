# Tractive
This repo is exceptionally for testing tasks.

This problem has a way simpler solution. Moreover, I made it for any number of stacks, but not for only 3. 


pizza.py - script with the solution
set1.yaml, set2.yaml, input.yaml - testing datasets
start.sh - shell script for starting 
You can start a script using 
# ./start.sh 
or directly using python f.ex.
# python pizza.py set2.yaml 
Do: 
# pip install -r requirements.txt
before startting
